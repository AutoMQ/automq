/**
 * <p>
 * Connectors manage integration of Kafka Connect with another system, either as an input that ingests
 * data into Kafka or an output that passes data to an external system. Implementations should
 * not use this class directly; they should inherit from {@link org.apache.kafka.connect.source.SourceConnector SourceConnector}
 * or {@link org.apache.kafka.connect.sink.SinkConnector SinkConnector}.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Connectors have two primary tasks. First, given some configuration, they are responsible for
 * creating configurations for a set of {@link Task}s that split up the data processing. For
 * example, a database Connector might create Tasks by dividing the set of tables evenly among
 * tasks. Second, they are responsible for monitoring inputs for changes that require
 * reconfiguration and notifying the Kafka Connect runtime via the {@link ConnectorContext}. Continuing the
 * previous example, the connector might periodically check for new tables and notify Kafka Connect of
 * additions and deletions. Kafka Connect will then request new configurations and update the running
 * Tasks.
 * </p>
