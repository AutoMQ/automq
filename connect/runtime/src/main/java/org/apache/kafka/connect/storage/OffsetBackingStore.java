 * operations, only bulk operations are supported.

 * Since OffsetBackingStore is a shared resource that may be used by many OffsetStorage instances
 * that are associated with individual tasks, the caller must be sure keys include information about the
 * connector so that the shared namespace does not result in conflicting keys.
