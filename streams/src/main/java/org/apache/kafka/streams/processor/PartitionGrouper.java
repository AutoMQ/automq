     *
     * Note that the grouping of partitions need to be <b>sticky</b> such that for a given partition, its assigned
     * task should always be the same regardless of the input parameters to this function. This is to ensure task's
     * local state stores remain valid through workload rebalances among Kafka Streams instances.

     * The default partition grouper implements this interface by assigning all partitions across different topics with the same
     * partition id into the same task. See {@link DefaultPartitionGrouper} for more information.
