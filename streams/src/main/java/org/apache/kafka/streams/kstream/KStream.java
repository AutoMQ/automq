/**
 * {@code KStream} is an abstraction of a <i>record stream</i> of {@link KeyValue} pairs, i.e., each record is an
 * independent entity/event in the real world.
 * For example a user X might buy two items I1 and I2, and thus there might be two records {@code <K:I1>, <K:I2>}
 * in the stream.
 * <p>
 * A {@code KStream} is either {@link StreamsBuilder#stream(String) defined from one or multiple Kafka topics} that
 * are consumed message by message or the result of a {@code KStream} transformation.
 * A {@link KTable} can also be {@link KTable#toStream() converted} into a {@code KStream}.
 * <p>
 * A {@code KStream} can be transformed record by record, joined with another {@code KStream}, {@link KTable},
 * {@link GlobalKTable}, or can be aggregated into a {@link KTable}.
 * Kafka Streams DSL can be mixed-and-matched with Processor API (PAPI) (c.f. {@link Topology}) via
 * {@link #process(ProcessorSupplier, String...) process(...)},
 * {@link #transform(TransformerSupplier, String...) transform(...)}, and
 * {@link #transformValues(ValueTransformerSupplier, String...) transformValues(...)}.
 *
 * @param <K> Type of keys
 * @param <V> Type of values
