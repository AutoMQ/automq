/**
 * The {@code KeyValueMapper} interface for mapping a {@link KeyValue key-value pair} to a new value of arbitrary type.
 * For example, it can be used to
 * <ul>
 * <li>map from an input {@link KeyValue} pair to an output {@link KeyValue} pair with different key and/or value type
 *     (for this case output type {@code VR == }{@link KeyValue KeyValue&lt;NewKeyType,NewValueType&gt;})</li>
 * <li>map from an input record to a new key (with arbitrary key type as specified by {@code VR})</li>
 * </ul>
 * This is a stateless record-by-record operation, i.e, {@link #apply(Object, Object)} is invoked individually for each
 * record of a stream (cf. {@link Transformer} for stateful record transformation).
 * {@code KeyValueMapper} is a generalization of {@link ValueMapper}.
