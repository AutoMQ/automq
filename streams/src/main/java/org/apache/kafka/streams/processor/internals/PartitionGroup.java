/**
 * PartitionGroup is used to buffer all co-partitioned records for processing.
 *
 * In other words, it represents the "same" partition over multiple co-partitioned topics, and it is used
 * to buffer records from that partition in each of the contained topic-partitions.
 * Each StreamTask has exactly one PartitionGroup.
 *
 * PartitionGroup implements the algorithm that determines in what order buffered records are selected for processing.
 *
 * Specifically, when polled, it returns the record from the topic-partition with the lowest stream-time.
 * Stream-time for a topic-partition is defined as the highest timestamp
 * yet observed at the head of that topic-partition.
 *
 * PartitionGroup also maintains a stream-time for the group as a whole.
 * This is defined as the highest timestamp of any record yet polled from the PartitionGroup.
 * Note however that any computation that depends on stream-time should track it on a per-operator basis to obtain an
 * accurate view of the local time as seen by that processor.
 *
 * The PartitionGroups's stream-time is initially UNKNOWN (-1), and it set to a known value upon first poll.
 * As a consequence of the definition, the PartitionGroup's stream-time is non-decreasing
 * (i.e., it increases or stays the same over time).
