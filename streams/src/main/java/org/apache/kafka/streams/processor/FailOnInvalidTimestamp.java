/**
 * Retrieves embedded metadata timestamps from Kafka messages.
 * If a record has a negative (invalid) timestamp value, this extractor raises an exception.
 * <p>
 * Embedded metadata timestamp was introduced in "KIP-32: Add timestamps to Kafka message" for the new
 * 0.10+ Kafka message format.
 * <p>
 * Here, "embedded metadata" refers to the fact that compatible Kafka producer clients automatically and
 * transparently embed such timestamps into message metadata they send to Kafka, which can then be retrieved
 * via this timestamp extractor.
 * <p>
 * If the embedded metadata timestamp represents <i>CreateTime</i> (cf. Kafka broker setting
 * {@code message.timestamp.type} and Kafka topic setting {@code log.message.timestamp.type}),
 * this extractor effectively provides <i>event-time</i> semantics.
 * If <i>LogAppendTime</i> is used as broker/topic setting to define the embedded metadata timestamps,
 * using this extractor effectively provides <i>ingestion-time</i> semantics.
 * <p>
 * If you need <i>processing-time</i> semantics, use {@link WallclockTimestampExtractor}.
