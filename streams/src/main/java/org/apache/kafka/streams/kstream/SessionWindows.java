/**
 * A session based window specification used for aggregating events into sessions.
 * <p>
 * Sessions represent a period of activity separated by a defined gap of inactivity.
 * Any events processed that fall within the inactivity gap of any existing sessions are merged into the existing sessions.
 * If the event falls outside of the session gap then a new session will be created.
 * <p>
 * For example, if we have a session gap of 5 and the following data arrives:
 * <pre>
 * +--------------------------------------+
 * |    key    |    value    |    time    |
 * +-----------+-------------+------------+
 * |    A      |     1       |     10     |
 * +-----------+-------------+------------+
 * |    A      |     2       |     12     |
 * +-----------+-------------+------------+
 * |    A      |     3       |     20     |
 * +-----------+-------------+------------+
 * </pre>
 * We'd have 2 sessions for key A.
 * One starting from time 10 and ending at time 12 and another starting and ending at time 20.
 * The length of the session is driven by the timestamps of the data within the session.
 * Thus, session windows are no fixed-size windows (c.f. {@link TimeWindows} and {@link JoinWindows}).
 * <p>
 * If we then received another record:
 * <pre>
 * +--------------------------------------+
 * |    key    |    value    |    time    |
 * +-----------+-------------+------------+
 * |    A      |     4       |     16     |
 * +-----------+-------------+------------+
 * </pre>
 * The previous 2 sessions would be merged into a single session with start time 10 and end time 20.
 * The aggregate value for this session would be the result of aggregating all 4 values.
 * <p>
 * For time semantics, see {@link TimestampExtractor}.
