## Code Contributions

Most of the issues open for contributions are tagged with 'good first issue.' To claim one, simply reply with 'pick up' in the issue and the AutoMQ maintainers will assign the issue to you. If you have any questions about the 'good first issue' please feel free to ask. We will do our best to clarify any doubts you may have.
Start with
this [tagged good first issue](https://github.com/AutoMQ/automq-for-kafka/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22)

The usual workflow of code contribution is:

1. Fork the AutoMQ repository.
2. Clone the repository locally.
3. Create a branch for your feature/bug fix with the format `{YOUR_USERNAME}/{FEATURE/BUG}` (
   e.g. `jdoe/source-stock-api-stream-fix`)
4. Make and commit changes.
5. Push your local branch to your fork.
6. Submit a Pull Request so that we can review your changes.
7. [Link an existing Issue](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue)
   that does not include the `needs triage` label to your Pull Request. A pull request without a linked issue will be
   closed, otherwise.
8. Write a PR title and description that follows the [Pull Request Handbook](./resources/pull-requests-handbook.md)
   and [Pull Request Template](https://github.com/airbytehq/airbyte/blob/master/.github/pull_request_template.md).
9. An AutoMQ maintainer will trigger the CI tests for you and review the code.
10. Review and respond to feedback and questions by AutoMQ maintainers.
11. Merge the contribution.

Pull Request reviews are done on a regular basis.
