> [2] AutoMQ's flexible architecture can utilize the durability of various cloud storage services like S3, Regional EBS, and EFS, all offering multi-AZ durability.

## üî∂ Why AutoMQ

- **Cost effective**: The first true cloud-native streaming storage system, designed for optimal cost and efficiency on the cloud. Refer to [this report](https://docs.automq.com/docs/automq-opensource/EV6mwoC95ihwRckMsUKcppnqnJb) to see how we cut Apache Kafka billing by 90% on the cloud.
- **High Reliability**: Leverage cloud-shared storage services to achieve zero RPO, RTO in seconds and 99.999999999% durability.
- **Serverless**:
  - Auto Scaling: Monitor cluster metrics and automatically scale in/out to align with your workload, enabling a pay-as-you-go model.
  - Scaling in seconds: The computing layer (broker) is stateless and can scale in/out within seconds, making AutoMQ a truly serverless solution.
  - Infinite scalable: Utilize cloud object storage as the primary storage solution, eliminating concerns about storage capacity.
- **Manage-less**: The built-in auto-balancer component automatically schedules partitions and network traffic between brokers, eliminating manual partition reassignment.
- **High performance**:
  - Low latency: Accelerate writing with high-performance EBS as WAL, achieving single-digit millisecond latency.
  - High throughput: Leverage pre-fetching, batch processing, and parallel technologies to maximize the capabilities of cloud object storage.
  > Refer to the [AutoMQ Performance White Paper](https://docs.automq.com/docs/automq-opensource/IJLQwnVROiS5cUkXfF0cuHnWnNd) to see how we achieve this.
- **A superior alternative to Apache Kafka**: 100% compatible with Apache Kafka and does not lose any key features, but cheaper and better.

## ‚ú®Architecture

![image](./docs/images/automq_simple_arch.png)

AutoMQ's Shared Storage architecture revolutionizes the storage layer of Apache Kafka by offloading data to cloud storage, thereby rendering the Broker stateless. This architecture incorporates both WAL (Write-Ahead Logging) storage and object storage, storing all data in object storage in near real-time.

In this setup:

- Object storage is the primary data repository, providing a flexible, cost-effective, and scalable storage solution.
- AutoMQ introduces a WAL storage layer to counter the high latency and low IOPS associated with Object storage, thereby improving data write efficiency and lowering IOPS usage.
- The WAL storage layer is adaptable, allowing for the selection of various storage services across different cloud providers to cater to diverse durability and performance needs. Azure Zone-redundant Disk, GCP Regional Persistent Disk, and Alibaba Cloud Regional ESSD are ideal for ensuring multi-AZ durability. For cost-effective solutions on AWS with relaxed latency scenarios, S3 can serve as WAL. Additionally, AWS EFS/FSx can balance latency and cost for critical workloads when used as WAL.

AutoMQ has developed a shared streaming storage library, S3Stream, which encapsulates these storage modules. By replacing the native Apache Kafka¬Æ Log storage with S3Stream, the entire Broker node becomes entirely stateless. This transformation significantly streamlines operations such as second-level partition reassignment, automatic scaling, and traffic self-balancing. To facilitate this, AutoMQ has integrated Controller components like Auto Scaling and Auto Balancing within its kernel, which oversee cluster scaling operations and traffic rebalancing, respectively. Please refer to [here](https://docs.automq.com/automq/architecture/overview) for more architecture details.

## üê± The relationship with Apache Kafka

AutoMQ is a fork of the open-source [Apache Kafka](https://github.com/apache/kafka). Based on the Apache Kafka codebase, we found an aspect at the LogSegment level, and replaced Kafka's storage layer with our self-developed cloud-native stream storage engine, [S3Stream](https://github.com/AutoMQ/automq/tree/main/s3stream). This engine can provide customers with high-performance, low-cost, and unlimited stream storage capabilities based on cloud storage like EBS WAL and S3. As such, AutoMQ completely retains the code of Kafka's computing layer and is 100% fully compatible with Apache Kafka. We appreciate the work done by the Apache Kafka community and will continue to embrace the Kafka community.
