> [1] Apache Kafka Compatibility's definition is coming from this [blog](https://www.kai-waehner.de/blog/2021/05/09/kafka-api-de-facto-standard-event-streaming-like-amazon-s3-object-storage/).

> [2] EBS Durability: On Azure, GCP, and Alibaba Cloud, Regional EBS replicas span multiple AZs. On AWS, ensure durability by double writing to EBS and S3 Express One Zone in different AZs.

## üî∂ Why AutoMQ

- **Cost effective**: The first true cloud-native streaming storage system, designed for optimal cost and efficiency on the cloud. Refer to [this report](https://docs.automq.com/docs/automq-opensource/EV6mwoC95ihwRckMsUKcppnqnJb) to see how we cut Apache Kafka billing by 90% on the cloud.
- **High Reliability**: Leverage cloud-shared storage services(EBS and S3) to achieve zero RPO, RTO in seconds and 99.999999999% durability.
- **Serverless**:
  - Auto Scaling: Monitor cluster metrics and automatically scale in/out to align with your workload, enabling a pay-as-you-go model.
  - Scaling in seconds: The computing layer (broker) is stateless and can scale in/out within seconds, making AutoMQ a truly serverless solution.
  - Infinite scalable: Utilize cloud object storage as the primary storage solution, eliminating concerns about storage capacity.
- **Manage-less**: The built-in auto-balancer component automatically schedules partitions and network traffic between brokers, eliminating manual partition reassignment.
- **High performance**:
  - Low latency: Accelerate writing with high-performance EBS as WAL, achieving single-digit millisecond latency.
  - High throughput: Leverage pre-fetching, batch processing, and parallel technologies to maximize the capabilities of cloud object storage.
  > Refer to the [AutoMQ Performance White Paper](https://docs.automq.com/docs/automq-opensource/IJLQwnVROiS5cUkXfF0cuHnWnNd) to see how we achieve this.
- **A superior alternative to Apache Kafka**: 100% compatible with Apache Kafka and does not lose any key features, but cheaper and better.

## ‚ú®Architecture

![image](./docs/images/automq_vs_kafka.gif)

AutoMQ adopts a Shared-Storage architecture, replacing the storage layer of Apache Kafka with a shared streaming storage library called [S3Stream](https://github.com/AutoMQ/automq/tree/main/s3stream) in a storage-compute separation manner, making the Broker completely stateless.

Compared to the classic Kafka Shared-Nothing or Tiered-Storage architectures, AutoMQ's computing layer (Broker) is truly stateless, enabling features such as Auto-Scaling, Self-Balancing, and Partition Reassignment in Seconds that significantly reduce costs and improve efficiency.
