# Contributor Guidance for Google Summer of Code

## General Guidelines

1. **Read Official Guides:** Start by reading the [Contributor Guide](https://google.github.io/gsocguides/student/) written by the Google Summer of Code organizers.
2. **Understand the Process:** Ensure you understand the GSoC timeline, application process, and the specific project you are applying for. We assume best intentions from all contributors throughout this period.
3. **Join the Community:** Join our [Slack](https://go.automq.com/slack) and introduce yourself in the `#introduce` channel.
4. **Start Early:** Begin drafting your proposal as early as possible using the template provided below. If you are new to AutoMQ, we highly recommend trying out our [Getting Started Guide](https://docs.automq.com/automq/getting-started) first.
5. **Holistic Contribution:** We value all forms of contribution, including helping others on Slack, triaging GitHub issues, and reviewing pull requests. We prefer contributors who aim to support the community as a whole, not just the codebase.
6. **Contributor Readiness:** Solving `good-first-issues` will show us that you can be a good GSoC contributor.
7. **Mentor Interaction:** Reach out to and interact with mentors to discuss your solution and technical approach before submitting your final proposal.

## 1. Picking up and Working on Issues

- **Progressive Difficulty:** If you feel confident, you are welcome to help with other non-labeled issues, though we suggest starting with an easier task to familiarize yourself with our workflow.
- **Assignment Policy:** To manage the influx of potential contributors and ensure timely resolutions, we will only assign issues to contributors who explicitly ask. If a PR is already open for an issue, please do not open a duplicate.
- **The Value of Reviews:** We consider the quality of the reviews you leave on other contributors' PRs when evaluating your final proposal. Investigating an issue yourself—even if you don't solve it—helps you provide high-quality feedback. However, please refrain from "spammy" or low-effort reviews.
- **Stuck? Reach Out:** If you find it difficult to claim an issue because others are faster, please message us on Slack. We will help find a suitable task for you.

## 2. Writing Your Proposal

Your proposal should demonstrate a clear understanding of how you plan to approach the project idea. Don't worry about building a perfect minute-by-minute schedule for the entire summer; we will refine the timeline together once the official mentoring period begins.

## Proposal Template

- **Motivation:** What excites you about this project? What do you plan to achieve personally and professionally, and how will you measure success?
- **Project Plan:** This should be the most extensive portion of your proposal. List clear deliverables, technical intricacies, architecture diagrams, and code snippets. It should clearly depict your deep understanding of the problem.

#### Additional Information
