            <a href="#quickstart_createtopic">Step 3: Create a topic to store your events</a>
        </h4>

        <p>
            Kafka is a distributed <em>event streaming platform</em> that lets you read, write, store, and process
            <a href="/documentation/#messages"><em>events</em></a> (also called <em>records</em> or
            <em>messages</em> in the documentation)
            across many machines.
        </p>

        <p>
            Example events are payment transactions, geolocation updates from mobile phones, shipping orders, sensor measurements
            from IoT devices or medical equipment, and much more. These events are organized and stored in
            <a href="/documentation/#intro_concepts_and_terms"><em>topics</em></a>.
            Very simplified, a topic is similar to a folder in a filesystem, and the events are the files in that folder.
        </p>

        <p>
            So before you can write your first events, you must create a topic.  Open another terminal session and run:
        </p>

        <pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-bash">$ bin/kafka-topics.sh --create --topic quickstart-events --bootstrap-server localhost:9092</code></pre>

        <p>
            All of Kafka's command line tools have additional options: run the <code>kafka-topics.sh</code> command without any
            arguments to display usage information. For example, it can also show you
            <a href="/documentation/#intro_concepts_and_terms">details such as the partition count</a>
            of the new topic:
        </p>

        <pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-bash">$ bin/kafka-topics.sh --describe --topic quickstart-events --bootstrap-server localhost:9092
Topic:quickstart-events  PartitionCount:1    ReplicationFactor:1 Configs:
    Topic: quickstart-events Partition: 0    Leader: 0   Replicas: 0 Isr: 0</code></pre>
    </div>

    <div class="quickstart-step">
        <h4 class="anchor-heading">
            <a class="anchor-link" id="quickstart_send" href="#quickstart_send"></a>
            <a href="#quickstart_send">Step 4: Write some events into the topic</a>
        </h4>

        <p>
            A Kafka client communicates with the Kafka brokers via the network for writing (or reading) events.
            Once received, the brokers will store the events in a durable and fault-tolerant manner for as long as you
            needâ€”even forever.
        </p>

        <p>
            Run the console producer client to write a few events into your topic.
            By default, each line you enter will result in a separate event being written to the topic.
        </p>

        <pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-bash">$ bin/kafka-console-producer.sh --topic quickstart-events --bootstrap-server localhost:9092
This is my first event
This is my second event</code></pre>

        <p>
            You can stop the producer client with <code>Ctrl-C</code> at any time.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="quickstart-step">
        <h4 class="anchor-heading">
            <a class="anchor-link" id="quickstart_consume" href="#quickstart_consume"></a>
            <a href="#quickstart_consume">Step 5: Read the events</a>
        </h4>

        <p>Open another terminal session and run the console consumer client to read the events you just created:</p>

        <pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-bash">$ bin/kafka-console-consumer.sh --topic quickstart-events --from-beginning --bootstrap-server localhost:9092
This is my first event
This is my second event</code></pre>

        <p>You can stop the consumer client with <code>Ctrl-C</code> at any time.</p>

        <p>Feel free to experiment: for example, switch back to your producer terminal (previous step) to write
            additional events, and see how the events immediately show up in your consumer terminal.</p>

        <p>Because events are durably stored in Kafka, they can be read as many times and by as many consumers as you want.
            You can easily verify this by opening yet another terminal session and re-running the previous command again.</p>

        </h4>

        <p>
            You probably have lots of data in existing systems like relational databases or traditional messaging systems,
            along with many applications that already use these systems.
            <a href="/documentation/#connect">Kafka Connect</a> allows you to continuously ingest
            data from external systems into Kafka, and vice versa.  It is thus very easy to integrate existing systems with
            Kafka. To make this process even easier, there are hundreds of such connectors readily available.
        </p>

        <p>Take a look at the <a href="/documentation/#connect">Kafka Connect section</a>
            to learn more about how to continuously import/export your data into and out of Kafka.</p>

            <a href="#quickstart_kafkastreams">Step 7: Process your events with Kafka Streams</a>
        </h4>

        <p>
            Once your data is stored in Kafka as events, you can process the data with the
            <a href="/documentation/streams">Kafka Streams</a> client library for Java/Scala.
            It allows you to implement mission-critical real-time applications and microservices, where the input
            and/or output data is stored in Kafka topics.  Kafka Streams combines the simplicity of writing and deploying
            standard Java and Scala applications on the client side with the benefits of Kafka's server-side cluster
            technology to make these applications highly scalable, elastic, fault-tolerant, and distributed. The library
            supports exactly-once processing, stateful operations and aggregations, windowing, joins, processing based
            on event-time, and much more.
        </p>

        <p>To give you a first taste, here's how one would implement the popular <code>WordCount</code> algorithm:</p>

        <pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-bash">KStream&lt;String, String&gt; textLines = builder.stream("quickstart-events");

KTable&lt;String, Long&gt; wordCounts = textLines
            .flatMapValues(line -&gt; Arrays.asList(line.toLowerCase().split(" ")))
            .groupBy((keyIgnored, word) -&gt; word)
            .count();

wordCounts.toStream().to("output-topic", Produced.with(Serdes.String(), Serdes.Long()));</code></pre>

        <p>
            The <a href="/25/documentation/streams/quickstart">Kafka Streams demo</a>
            and the <a href="/25/documentation/streams/tutorial">app development tutorial</a>
            demonstrate how to code and run such a streaming application from start to finish.

        </h4>

        <p>
            Now that you reached the end of the quickstart, feel free to tear down the Kafka environmentâ€”or
            continue playing around.
        </p>

        <ol>
            <li>
                Stop the producer and consumer clients with <code>Ctrl-C</code>, if you haven't done so already.
            </li>
            <li>
                Stop the Kafka broker with <code>Ctrl-C</code>.
            </li>
            <li>
                Lastly, stop the ZooKeeper server with <code>Ctrl-C</code>.
            </li>
        </ol>

        <p>
            If you also want to delete any data of your local Kafka environment including any events you have created
            along the way, run the command:
        </p>
