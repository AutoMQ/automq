<script id="configuration-template" type="text/x-handlebars-template">
  Kafka uses key-value pairs in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.properties">property file format</a> for configuration. These values can be supplied either from a file or programmatically.

  <h3><a id="brokerconfigs" href="#brokerconfigs">3.1 Broker Configs</a></h3>

  The essential configurations are the following:
  <ul>
      <li><code>broker.id</code>
      <li><code>log.dirs</code>
      <li><code>zookeeper.connect</code>
  </ul>

  Topic-level configurations and defaults are discussed in more detail <a href="#topicconfigs">below</a>.

  <!--#include virtual="generated/kafka_config.html" -->

  <p>More details about broker configuration can be found in the scala class <code>kafka.server.KafkaConfig</code>.</p>

  <h3><a id="topicconfigs" href="#topicconfigs">3.2 Topic-Level Configs</a></h3>

  Configurations pertinent to topics have both a server default as well an optional per-topic override. If no per-topic configuration is given the server default is used. The override can be set at topic creation time by giving one or more <code>--config</code> options. This example creates a topic named <i>my-topic</i> with a custom max message size and flush rate:
  <pre class="brush: bash;">
  &gt; bin/kafka-topics.sh --zookeeper localhost:2181 --create --topic my-topic --partitions 1
      --replication-factor 1 --config max.message.bytes=64000 --config flush.messages=1
  </pre>
  Overrides can also be changed or set later using the alter configs command. This example updates the max message size for <i>my-topic</i>:
  <pre class="brush: bash;">
  &gt; bin/kafka-configs.sh --zookeeper localhost:2181 --entity-type topics --entity-name my-topic
      --alter --add-config max.message.bytes=128000
  </pre>

  To check overrides set on the topic you can do
  <pre class="brush: bash;">
  &gt; bin/kafka-configs.sh --zookeeper localhost:2181 --entity-type topics --entity-name my-topic --describe
  </pre>

  To remove an override you can do
  <pre class="brush: bash;">
  &gt; bin/kafka-configs.sh --zookeeper localhost:2181  --entity-type topics --entity-name my-topic --alter --delete-config max.message.bytes
  </pre>

  The following are the topic-level configurations. The server's default configuration for this property is given under the Server Default Property heading. A given server default config value only applies to a topic if it does not have an explicit topic config override.

  <h3><a id="producerconfigs" href="#producerconfigs">3.3 Producer Configs</a></h3>

  Below is the configuration of the Java producer:
  <!--#include virtual="generated/producer_config.html" -->

  <p>
      For those interested in the legacy Scala producer configs, information can be found <a href="http://kafka.apache.org/082/documentation.html#producerconfigs">
      here</a>.
  </p>

  <h3><a id="consumerconfigs" href="#consumerconfigs">3.4 Consumer Configs</a></h3>

  In 0.9.0.0 we introduced the new Java consumer as a replacement for the older Scala-based simple and high-level consumers.
  The configs for both new and old consumers are described below.

  <h4><a id="newconsumerconfigs" href="#newconsumerconfigs">3.4.1 New Consumer Configs</a></h4>
  Below is the configuration for the new consumer:
  <!--#include virtual="generated/consumer_config.html" -->

  <h4><a id="oldconsumerconfigs" href="#oldconsumerconfigs">3.4.2 Old Consumer Configs</a></h4>

  The essential old consumer configurations are the following:
  <ul>
          <li><code>group.id</code>
          <li><code>zookeeper.connect</code>
  </ul>

  <table class="data-table">

          <p>
      The server may also have a ZooKeeper chroot path as part of its ZooKeeper connection string which puts its data under some path in the global ZooKeeper namespace. If so the consumer should use the same chroot path in its connection string. For example to give a chroot path of <code>/chroot/path</code> you would give the connection string as  <code>hostname1:port1,hostname2:port2,hostname3:port3/chroot/path</code>.</td>

(i.e., the partition ownership counts will be within a delta of exactly one across all consumer threads.) Round-robin assignment is permitted only if: (a) Every topic has the same number of streams within a consumer instance (b) The set of subscribed topics is identical for every consumer instance within the group.<p> Range partitioning works on a per-topic basis. For each topic, we lay out the available partitions in numeric order and the consumer threads in lexicographic order. We then divide the number of partitions by the total number of consumer streams (threads) to determine the number of partitions to assign to each consumer. If it does not evenly divide, then the first few consumers will have one extra partition.</td>
