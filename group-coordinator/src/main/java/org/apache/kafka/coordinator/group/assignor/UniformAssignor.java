 *         <b> Optimized Uniform Assignment Builder: </b> This strategy is used when all members have subscribed
 *         to the same set of topics.

 *         <b> General Uniform Assignment Builder: </b> This strategy is used when members have varied topic

 *
 * The appropriate strategy is automatically chosen based on the current members' topic subscriptions.
