/**
 * The CurrentAssignmentBuilder class encapsulates the reconciliation engine of the
 * consumer group protocol. Given the current state of a member and a desired or target
 * assignment state, the state machine takes the necessary steps to converge them.
 *
 * The member state has the following properties:
 * - Current Epoch:
 *   The current epoch of the member.
 *
 * - Next Epoch:
 *   The desired epoch of the member. It corresponds to the epoch of the target/desired assignment.
 *   The member transitions to this epoch when it has revoked the partitions that it does not own
 *   or if it does not have to revoke any.
 *
 * - Previous Epoch:
 *   The epoch of the member when the state was last updated.
 *
 * - Assigned Partitions:
 *   The set of partitions currently assigned to the member. This represents what the member should have.
 *
 * - Partitions Pending Revocation:
 *   The set of partitions that the member should revoke before it can transition to the next state.
 *
 * - Partitions Pending Assignment:
 *   The set of partitions that the member will eventually receive. The partitions in this set are
 *   still owned by other members in the group.
 *
 * The state machine has three states:
 * - REVOKING:
 *   This state means that the member must revoke partitions before it can transition to the next epoch
 *   and thus start receiving new partitions. This is to guarantee that offsets of revoked partitions
 *   are committed with the current epoch. The member transitions to the next state only when it has
 *   acknowledged the revocation.
 *
 * - ASSIGNING:
 *   This state means that the member waits on partitions which are still owned by other members in the
 *   group. It remains in this state until they are all freed up.
 *
 * - STABLE:
 *   This state means that the member has received all its assigned partitions.
 *
 * The reconciliation process is started or re-started whenever a new target assignment is installed;
 * the epoch of the new target assignment is different from the next epoch of the member. In this transient
 * state, the assigned partitions, the partitions pending revocation and the partitions pending assignment
 * are updated. If the partitions pending revocation is not empty, the state machine transitions to
 * REVOKING; if partitions pending assignment is not empty, it transitions to ASSIGNING; otherwise it
 * transitions to STABLE.
