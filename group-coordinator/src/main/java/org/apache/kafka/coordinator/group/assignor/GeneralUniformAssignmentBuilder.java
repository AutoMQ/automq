/**
 * The general uniform assignment builder is used to generate the target assignment for a consumer group with
 * at least one of its members subscribed to a different set of topics.
 *
 * Assignments are done according to the following principles:
 *
 * <li> Balance:          Ensure partitions are distributed equally among all members.
 *                        The difference in assignments sizes between any two members
 *                        should not exceed one partition. </li>
 * <li> Rack Matching:    When feasible, aim to assign partitions to members
 *                        located on the same rack thus avoiding cross-zone traffic. </li>
 * <li> Stickiness:       Minimize partition movements among members by retaining
 *                        as much of the existing assignment as possible. </li>
 *
 * This assignment builder prioritizes the above properties in the following order:
 *      Balance > Rack Matching > Stickiness.
