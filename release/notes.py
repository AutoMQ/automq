Usage: python notes.py <version> > RELEASE_NOTES.html

Generates release notes for a release in HTML format containing
introductory information about the release with links to the
Kafka docs and the list of issues resolved in the release.

The script will fail if there are any unresolved issues still
marked with the target release. This script should be run after either
resolving all issues or moving outstanding issues to a later release.
