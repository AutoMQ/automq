/**
 * Tracks the registration of a specific broker, and executes a callback if it should be refreshed.
 *
 * This tracker handles cases where we might want to re-register the broker. The only such case
 * right now is during the transition from non-JBOD mode, to JBOD mode. In other words, the
 * transition from a MetadataVersion less than 3.7-IV2, to one greater than or equal to 3.7-IV2.
 * In this case, the broker registration will start out containing no directories, and we need to
 * resend the BrokerRegistrationRequest to fix that.
 *
 * As much as possible, the goal here is to keep things simple. We just compare the desired state
 * with the actual state, and try to make changes only if necessary.
