This directory contains examples of client code that uses kafka.

To run the demo: 

   1. Start Zookeeper and the Kafka server
   2. For simple consumer demo, `run bin/java-simple-consumer-demo.sh`
   3. For unlimited sync-producer-consumer run, `run bin/java-producer-consumer-demo.sh sync`
   4. For unlimited async-producer-consumer run, `run bin/java-producer-consumer-demo.sh`
   5. For standalone mode exactly once demo run, `run bin/exactly-once-demo.sh standaloneMode 6 3 50000`,
      this means we are starting 3 EOS instances with 6 topic partitions and 50000 pre-populated records
   6. For group mode exactly once demo run, `run bin/exactly-once-demo.sh groupMode 6 3 50000`,
      this means the same as the standalone demo, except consumers are using subscription mode.
   7. Some notes for exactly once demo:
      7.1. The Kafka server has to be on broker version 2.5 or higher to be able to run group mode.
      7.2. You could also use Intellij to run the example directly by configuring parameters as "Program arguments"
