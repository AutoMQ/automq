# Code of Conduct

## Pledge

We as contributors and maintainers pledge to foster an open, inclusive, and welcoming environment. Participation in our project and community should remain harassment‑free for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio‑economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

### Positive behaviors include:

* Using welcoming and inclusive language
* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
* Focusing on what is best for the community
* Showing empathy towards other community members
* Respecting the work of others by recognizing acknowledgment/citation requests by original authors
* Being explicit about how we want our own work to be cited or acknowledged

### Unacceptable behaviors include:

* Sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
* Sexist, racist, or exclusionary jokes
* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information without explicit permission
* Any conduct that may be considered inappropriate in a professional environment

## Additional Standards (New)

### AI‑Generated Content Transparency

Contributors must clearly disclose when a pull request, design, or code snippet is generated using AI tools (e.g., GitHub Copilot, ChatGPT) to maintain transparency and assist reviewers.

### Mental Well‑Being Consideration

Contributors are encouraged to prioritize their mental health. If overwhelmed, they may step back temporarily. The community will respect such breaks without judgment.

### Misrepresentation and Identity Integrity

Contributors must not misrepresent their identity, role, or expertise. False claims, impersonation, or misleading identity use are prohibited.

### Respect for Maintainers' Time

Demanding urgent reviews, spamming maintainers, or repeatedly pushing for immediate responses is disruptive. Contributors should respect the voluntary nature of open‑source maintenance.

### Contribution Integrity

Submitting malicious, intentionally broken, plagiarized, or unattributed code is strictly forbidden. All contributions must be honest and in good faith.

### Collaboration Over Competition

Contributors should prioritize cooperation, share credit, and avoid creating unnecessary conflict or competition.

### Zero‑Tolerance for Hate or Extremism

Any content promoting hate groups, violence, or extremist ideologies—directly or indirectly—will result in immediate removal and potential ban.

### Privacy‑First Rule

Recording, screenshotting, or sharing private conversations (e.g., Slack, Discord, DMs) without explicit permission is strictly prohibited.

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers must clarify standards of acceptable behavior and take fair corrective action when unacceptable behavior occurs. They may remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, issues, or other contributions not aligned with this Code of Conduct.

Maintainers not acting in good faith in enforcing the Code may face repercussions decided by project leadership.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the project maintainers at AutoMQ. All complaints will be reviewed confidentially and acted upon appropriately.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces and public spaces where individuals represent the project or its community. This includes official emails, social media accounts, and events.
