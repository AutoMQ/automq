/**
 * {@code ShareConsumerDelegateCreator} implements a quasi-factory pattern to allow the caller to remain unaware of the
 * underlying {@link ShareConsumer} implementation that is created. This provides the means by which
 * {@link KafkaShareConsumer} can remain the top-level facade for implementations, but allow different implementations
 * to co-exist under the covers.
 *
 * <p>
 * <em>Note</em>: this is for internal use only and is not intended for use by end users. Internal users should
 * not attempt to determine the underlying implementation to avoid coding to an unstable interface. Rather, it is
 * the {@link ShareConsumer} API contract that should serve as the caller's interface.
