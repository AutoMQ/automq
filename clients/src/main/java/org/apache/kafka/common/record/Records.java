/**
 * Interface for accessing the records contained in a log. The log itself is represented as a sequence of record
 * batches (see {@link RecordBatch}).
 *
 * For magic versions 1 and below, each batch consists of an 8 byte offset, a 4 byte record size, and a "shallow"
 * {@link Record record}. If the batch is not compressed, then each batch will have only the shallow record contained
 * inside it. If it is compressed, the batch contains "deep" records, which are packed into the value field of the
 * shallow record. To iterate over the shallow batches, use {@link Records#batches()}; for the deep records, use
 * {@link Records#records()}. Note that the deep iterator handles both compressed and non-compressed batches:
 * if the batch is not compressed, the shallow record is returned; otherwise, the shallow batch is decompressed and the
 * deep records are returned.
 *
 * For magic version 2, every batch contains 1 or more log record, regardless of compression. You can iterate
 * over the batches directly using {@link Records#batches()}. Records can be iterated either directly from an individual
 * batch or through {@link Records#records()}. Just as in previous versions, iterating over the records typically involves
 * decompression and should therefore be used with caution.
 *
 * See {@link MemoryRecords} for the in-memory representation and {@link FileRecords} for the on-disk representation.
